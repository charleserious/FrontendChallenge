# Countdown

An Angular app built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) and [karma-jasmine](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine). Simply provide an event name and date, then the countdown will start ticking.

## Develop

This project is straightforward. Install the dependencies and start the development server. Each PR merged to the master branch will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm test`, which runs the unit tests
3. `npm start`, which runs `ng serve` under the hood
